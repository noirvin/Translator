This web-app extracts the binary buffer of an uploaded file, and encodes it to a nucleotide sequence.
Binary representation of the data can be seen if entry title is clicked on.
The nucleotidecode representation can actually be used to encode and essentially store data on DNA strands by using accurate sequencing technologies such as CRISPR Cas-9.

Please try to upload an image or text file under 10 kilobytes, because the app is not optimized to use large files yet.
